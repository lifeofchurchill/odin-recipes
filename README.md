# odin-recipes


## Project Overview

This project is a simple recipe website built as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal of this project is to create a website that showcases various recipes. The site includes a homepage that links to individual recipe pages, each with its own ingredients and instructions.

### Skills Demonstrated

- **HTML**: Structured content for the website, including headings, lists, and links.
- **CSS**: (Optional) Styling the website to make it visually appealing (you can add a `styles.css` file for this).
- **Git**: Version control for tracking changes, managing branches, and collaborating.
- **GitHub**: Hosting the project repository remotely and pushing changes to GitHub.
- **Basic Web Development**: Building simple static pages and linking them together.

## Purpose

This project will demonstrate my ability to build a basic multi-page website using only HTML. By completing this project, I will practice using the following technologies:

- HTML structure for content.
- Creating and linking multiple pages.
- Using Git and GitHub for version control.

> *Self-reflection (to be written at the end of the project)*

At the end of the project, I plan to review what I’ve learned from building this website. I will reflect on the process of creating static web pages and how I’ve used Git to track progress. I’ll also assess my understanding of linking pages and structuring content.
